Installation of VS Code:
To install Visual Studio Code on Windows 11, follow these steps:
Download VS Code: Visit the official VS Code website and download the Windows installer (.exe).
Run the Installer: Once downloaded, run the installer. Follow the installation prompts and accept the default settings.
Prerequisites: Ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements for VS Code. This typically includes having Windows 7 or later with at least 1 GB RAM.
First-time Setup:
After installing VS Code, adjust the following settings for an optimal coding environment:
Extensions: Install essential extensions like "Live Server" for web development or language-specific extensions for your preferred programming languages.
Settings: Customize editor preferences such as font size, theme (dark or light), and keybindings (default or customized).
Terminal Shell: Set up your preferred terminal shell (e.g., PowerShell, Command Prompt, Git Bash) in VS Code.
User Interface Overview:
Activity Bar: Provides quick access to different views like Explorer, Search, Source Control, and Extensions.
Side Bar: Contains views like Explorer (file browser), Search, Git (Source Control), and extensions.
Editor Group: Displays open files or editors. You can split this area horizontally or vertically to view multiple files simultaneously.
Status Bar: Shows information about the current file, Git branch, encoding, and line endings.
Command Palette:
The Command Palette in VS Code allows you to execute commands and tasks:
Access: Open using Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac).
Examples: Search for commands (View: Toggle Terminal), run tasks (Tasks: Run Task), or install extensions (Extensions: Install Extensions).
Extensions in VS Code:
Extensions enhance VS Code functionality:
Find and Install: Go to the Extensions view in the Activity Bar, search for an extension, and click "Install".
Manage: Disable, uninstall, or update extensions easily.
Examples: Essential extensions for web development include "Live Server" for live previews and "ESLint" for JavaScript linting.
Integrated Terminal:
To use the integrated terminal:
Open: Use `Ctrl+`` (backtick) to open the terminal.
Advantages: Convenient access within the editor, supports multiple shells, and integrates with tasks and debugging.
File and Folder Management:
Create: Right-click in the Explorer view and choose "New File" or "New Folder".
Open: Double-click a file to open it. Use the Explorer view to navigate between files and folders.
Settings and Preferences:
Customize: Access settings via File > Preferences > Settings (Windows/Linux) or Code > Preferences > Settings (Mac).
Examples: Change the theme (workbench.colorTheme), adjust font size (editor.fontSize), or modify keybindings (keybindings.json).
Debugging in VS Code:
To debug a program:
Setup: Install any necessary debugging extensions. Create or open a project folder in VS Code.
Configure: Set breakpoints in your code by clicking in the gutter next to the line number.
Start Debugging: Press F5 or use the Debug view to start debugging. Use the Debug Console to interact with your application during debugging.
Using Source Control:
To use Git in VS Code:
Initialize Repository: Open a project folder, open the Source Control view (Ctrl+Shift+G), and initialize a Git repository.
Commits: Stage changes by clicking + next to changed files in the Source Control view, enter a commit message, and click the checkmark to commit.
Push Changes: Click the ellipsis (...) next to the commit message in the Source Control view and choose "Push" to push changes to GitHub or another remote repository.

These steps should help you get started with Visual Studio Code effectively for development on Windows 11.
